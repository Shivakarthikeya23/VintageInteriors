# VintageInteriors
It is a single page website of house application and furniture
We have designed this website using only Html, Css and JavaScript Though we can use bootstrap easily for making website responsive since they have mentioned 
single page website earlier that is the reason we did not use website 
To avoid confusion while reading the code we have made comments along with css code
IMAGE RESOURCES-
we have took the images from unsplash website 
And the icons from icons8 website
And only one image from google
CONTENT-
There is no dummy text at all and no copied content from anywhere
We and our team worked together to make content natural and original we have made it short because it is a single page website
PROBLEMS FACED-
The main problem we faced is editing the logo it was a tough job though we worked on it 
And bunch of css tags when we are trying to make it responsive by the help of W3 schools we solved it
